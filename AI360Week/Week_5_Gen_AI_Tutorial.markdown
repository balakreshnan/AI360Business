## Use Case Lifecycle (25 minutes)

### What is the Use Case Lifecycle?
The use case lifecycle is a structured process that guides you from identifying a business problem to deploying a Gen AI solution. It ensures alignment with business goals and delivers measurable value.

#### Stages of the Lifecycle
1. **Problem Identification**: Pinpoint a specific business challenge that Gen AI can address.  
2. **Feasibility Assessment**: Determine if Gen AI is suitable and if data and resources are available.  
3. **Solution Design**: Plan the AI solution, including model selection and integration points.  
4. **Development and Testing**: Build and test the solution in a controlled setting.  
5. **Deployment**: Launch the solution into production.  
6. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Track performance and improve the model over time.  

**Example**: A retail company tackled inaccurate inventory forecasts by identifying the issue, assessing feasibility, designing an AI model, testing it, deploying it, and continuously monitoring its accuracy.

### Quiz 1
**Question**: What is the first step in the use case lifecycle?  
- A) Solution Design  
- B) Problem Identification  
- C) Deployment  
- D) Monitoring  

**Answer**: B) Problem Identification

## Typical Team Structure (25 minutes)

### Who’s Involved?
A successful Gen AI project relies on a cross-functional team with varied expertise. Here’s a typical lineup:  
- **Project Sponsor**: An executive who champions the project and secures funding.  
- **AI Lead**: Oversees technical development and aligns it with business goals.  
- **Data Scientist**: Builds and trains the AI models.  
- **Data Engineer**: Manages data pipelines and ensures data quality.  
- **Domain Expert**: Offers business context and validates results.  
- **IT Specialist**: Handles infrastructure and system integration.  
- **Change Manager**: Facilitates user adoption and manages transitions.  

**Example**: A healthcare AI initiative included a chief medical officer (sponsor), an AI lead, data scientists, data engineers, doctors (domain experts), IT staff, and a change manager.

### Quiz 2
**Question**: Who ensures the AI solution integrates with existing systems?  
- A) Data Scientist  
- B) IT Specialist  
- C) Domain Expert  
- D) Project Sponsor  

**Answer**: B) IT Specialist

## POC vs. POT vs. Production (30 minutes)

### Definitions
- **Proof of Concept (POC)**: A small-scale trial to test if the idea is feasible.  
- **Proof of Technology (POT)**: A more thorough test to confirm the technology works under real-world conditions.  
- **Production**: Full deployment where the solution is part of daily operations.  

#### Key Differences
- **POC**: Fast, low-cost, focused on proving the concept.  
- **POT**: Tests scalability, reliability, and integration.  
- **Production**: Requires robust infrastructure, ongoing monitoring, and maintenance.  

**Example**: A bank tested Gen AI for loan approvals with a POC to check feasibility, a POT to validate it with real data, and then moved to production, cutting approval times by 50%.

### Quiz 3
**Question**: Which stage tests scalability?  
- A) POC  
- B) POT  
- C) Production  
- D) All of the above  

**Answer**: B) POT

## Real-World Case Studies (25 minutes)

### Case Study 1: Media Company
- **Problem**: Slow news summary creation.  
- **Solution**: Gen AI auto-generated summaries from articles.  
- **Team**: AI lead, data scientists, journalists (domain experts), IT specialists.  
- **Lifecycle**: Problem identified, feasibility checked, solution designed, tested, deployed, and monitored.  
- **Outcome**: Reduced summary time by 70%, boosted content output.  

### Case Study 2: Manufacturing Firm
- **Problem**: High defect rates in production.  
- **Solution**: Gen AI analyzed images for quality control.  
- **Team**: COO (sponsor), AI lead, data engineers, quality control experts.  
- **Lifecycle**: Problem identified, feasibility assessed, solution designed, developed, tested, deployed, and optimized.  
- **Outcome**: Cut defects by 30%, saving $1M yearly.  

### Quiz 4
**Question**: In the media company case, who likely served as the domain expert?  
- A) Data Scientist  
- B) Journalist  
- C) IT Specialist  
- D) Project Sponsor  

**Answer**: B) Journalist
