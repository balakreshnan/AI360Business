## Sample End-to-End Prompt-Based Solution (30 minutes)

### Scenario: Automating Product Descriptions
Imagine you run an online store selling handmade crafts. You want to automate product descriptions to save time and maintain consistency. Let’s use Gen AI to generate a description for a handmade ceramic mug.

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Define the Task**: Create a compelling product description.  
2. **Initial Prompt**: "Write a product description for a handmade ceramic mug."  
   - **Sample Output**: "This is a handmade ceramic mug for drinking." (Too basic!)  
3. **Refine the Prompt**: "Write a 100-word product description for a handmade ceramic mug, emphasizing its unique design, craftsmanship, and gift appeal. Use a warm, inviting tone."  
   - **Sample Output**: "Discover the charm of our handmade ceramic mug, lovingly crafted by artisans. Its unique design and cozy tones make it a perfect gift."  
4. **Iterate**: Add specifics like "available in blue or white, 12 oz capacity."  
5. **Integrate**: Connect the Gen AI model to your e-commerce platform via an API to auto-generate descriptions for new products.  

**Takeaway**: Refining prompts improves output quality and relevance.

### Quiz 1
**Question**: What is a key benefit of refining prompts in Gen AI?  
- A) Reducing model size  
- B) Improving output quality  
- C) Decreasing computation time  
- D) Eliminating the need for data  

**Answer**: B) Improving output quality

## How to Identify the Value of a Use Case (25 minutes)

### Prioritization Framework
To maximize Gen AI’s impact, prioritize use cases with high value and feasibility. Use a **Prioritization Matrix**:  
- **X-axis**: Business Impact (e.g., cost savings, revenue growth).  
- **Y-axis**: Implementation Complexity (e.g., technical effort, resources).  

#### Examples
- **High Impact, Low Complexity**: Automating customer FAQ responses.  
- **High Impact, High Complexity**: Building an AI-powered virtual assistant.  
- **Low Impact, Low Complexity**: Summarizing internal meetings.  
- **Low Impact, High Complexity**: Generating AI art for niche marketing.  

**Action**: Focus on "High Impact, Low Complexity" for quick wins.

### Case Study: Retail
- **Use Case**: Personalized marketing emails.  
- **Impact**: 15% increase in customer engagement.  
- **Complexity**: Low, using existing customer data.  

### Quiz 2
**Question**: Which use case is likely the highest priority?  
- A) High impact, low complexity  
- B) Low impact, low complexity  
- C) High impact, high complexity  
- D) Low impact, high complexity  

**Answer**: A) High impact, low complexity

## How to Evaluate Risk vs. Reward for a Gen AI Idea (25 minutes)

### Risk Assessment
Gen AI offers big rewards but has risks. Assess them systematically.

#### Key Risks
- **Technical**: Inaccurate outputs (e.g., "hallucinations").  
- **Operational**: Integration or maintenance issues.  
- **Ethical**: Bias or privacy concerns.  
- **Reputational**: Customer trust risks.  

#### Mitigation
- Test outputs thoroughly.  
- Add human oversight.  
- Be transparent about AI use.  

**Example**: A company’s AI chatbot gave wrong info due to poor training data. They fixed it with better data and oversight.

### Balancing Act
Score risks and rewards (1-5). Proceed if mitigated rewards outweigh risks.

### Quiz 3
**Question**: What is a common risk with Gen AI?  
- A) Increased employee satisfaction  
- B) Model hallucinations  
- C) Reduced operational costs  
- D) Enhanced data security  

**Answer**: B) Model hallucinations

## Benefits: TCO vs. ROI (20 minutes)

### Definitions
- **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)**: All costs (e.g., software, training, maintenance).  
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Financial gain vs. cost.  
  - Formula: `(Benefits - Costs) / Costs * 100%`  

#### Example Calculation
- **TCO**: $100,000 (tools, setup, staff training).  
- **Benefits**: $150,000 (time savings, sales boost).  
- **ROI**: `($150,000 - $100,000) / $100,000 * 100% = 50%`.  

**Insight**: High initial costs can yield strong long-term returns.

### Case Study: Manufacturing
- **Use Case**: Predictive maintenance.  
- **TCO**: $150,000.  
- **Benefits**: $400,000 in reduced downtime.  
- **ROI**: 166%.  

### Quiz 4
**Question**: What does TCO include?  
- A) Only the initial purchase price  
- B) All costs over the project’s lifetime  
- C) Only the benefits generated  
- D) Only the revenue increases  

**Answer**: B) All costs over the project’s lifetime
