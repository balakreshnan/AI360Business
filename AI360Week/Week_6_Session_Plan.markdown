## Vendor and Tools Assessments (30 minutes)

### Overview
Choosing the right vendors and tools is critical for operational success. This segment covers how to evaluate options systematically.

#### Key Assessment Criteria
- **Cost**: Upfront and ongoing expenses (e.g., licensing, support).  
- **Functionality**: Features that match your specific needs.  
- **Scalability**: Ability to support growth in users or data volume.  
- **Support**: Quality of vendor assistance and resources.  
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems.  

#### Process
1. **Shortlist Vendors**: Research options via reviews, peers, or industry reports.  
2. **Request Demos**: Test tools live to assess usability.  
3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Gather input from IT, end-users, and leadership.  
4. **Score Options**: Use a weighted scoring system to rank tools objectively.  

#### Case Study
A mid-sized firm evaluated two CRM systems: Salesforce and HubSpot. They prioritized integration with marketing tools and cost. After demos and stakeholder feedback, HubSpot was chosen for its ease of use and affordability.

### Interactive Element
**Poll**: Which criterion do you prioritize most when choosing tools? (Cost, Functionality, Scalability, Support, Integration)

## Productivity Suite and How to Increase Value (45 minutes)

### Overview
Productivity suites like Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace streamline workflows. This section explains how to unlock their full potential.

#### Strategies to Increase Value
1. **Automation**: Use tools like Power Automate (Microsoft) or Apps Script (Google) to reduce manual tasks.  
2. **Integration**: Link suites with other platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams with Slack).  
3. **Training**: Teach staff advanced features (e.g., PivotTables in Excel).  
4. **Customization**: Adapt tools to your processes (e.g., custom Google Docs templates).  

#### Examples
- **Microsoft 365**: A sales team automated report generation with Power Automate, saving 5 hours weekly.  
- **Google Workspace**: A remote team integrated Google Drive with Trello, improving project tracking by 15%.  

#### Deep Dive: Microsoft 365
- **Feature**: Teams for collaboration.  
- **Value Boost**: Integrate with SharePoint for centralized file access.  
- **Training Tip**: Use Planner within Teams to assign tasks efficiently.  

### Interactive Element
**Discussion**: Share one way your team uses a productivity suite. How could it be improved?

## Evaluate Frameworks to Assess Tools (30 minutes)

### Overview
Frameworks provide structure for tool evaluation. This segment introduces three approaches and their applications.

#### Frameworks
1. **SWOT Analysis**  
   - Strengths: What does the tool excel at?  
   - Weaknesses: Any limitations?  
   - Opportunities: Potential benefits?  
   - Threats: Risks or challenges?  
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**  
   - Quantify costs (e.g., $10,000/year) vs. benefits (e.g., $15,000 in time savings).  
3. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**  
   - Include all costs: purchase, training, maintenance, and upgrades.  

#### Application Example
**CBA for a Project Management Tool**:  
- **Costs**: $5,000 (licenses) + $2,000 (training) = $7,000.  
- **Benefits**: 100 hours saved annually at $100/hour = $10,000.  
- **Net Benefit**: $3,000.  

#### Walkthrough
Using CBA, assess adopting a new tool. Attendees calculate costs and benefits for a hypothetical tool, guided by a simple worksheet.

### Interactive Element
**Quick Exercise**: List one strength and one weakness of a tool you use, applying SWOT.
